# React Native using Expo and Typescript

<img src="https://github.com/janaagaard75/expo-and-typescript/raw/master/assets/app-icon.png" height="50">

This is a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) demo app using the [Expo framework](https://expo.io) and written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org).

This repo used to also contain a type definition file for Expo, but that work has been merged into the [`@types/expo`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/expo) package. The `expo` npm package now contains its own set of type definitions, so `@types/expo` is now ignore, and has been removed. There is currently a type check issue with the SVGs that I haven't figured out how to solve.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
- Optional: [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), since it includes the iOS Simulator. XCode only runs on Macs.
- Optional: [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), since it includes the Android Virtual Device Manager.

You don't need to install any global npm packages for this repo. `expo-cli` is included as a dev dependency.

## Warnings When Installing Packages

There are a surprising amount of of warnings when installing Node packages, because of peer dependencies not being correct. My guess is that the Expo team has a tough time getting all the added React Native libraries to play well together. This app seems to run fine, so I believe it's safe to ignore the warnings.

## Running the App

Start the local server. This will give you a QR code that you can scan using the Expo Client app on your mobile device.

```shell
yarn start
```

If you're on a Mac and have Xcode installed, you can run the app using the iOS Simulator with the following command. I am sure you can do something similar with Android.

```shell
yarn ios
```
